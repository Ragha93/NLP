### 1. The below notebook will be the first step to learning NLP (ie) Regular Expression "NLP-Step1-Regular Expression.ipynb"
### 2. The notebook "Normalization-stemming-lemmatization-Countvectorizer-TF-IDF.ipynb" contains the basic steps of normalizing the text. Post this we Stem or lemmatize the text to reduce vocabulary count and finally we convert them to vectors using Count Vectorizer or TF-IDF. Although CV or TF-IDF is never used in todays problem statement, its always good to know from where we started.


          

### Project1_NLP - This contains basic NLP classification problem solved through TF-IDF vectorizer and a mini Chatbot.
