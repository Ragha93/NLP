# NLP
This repositry contains all NLP related files. If you plan to learn NLP from Scratch this is the right repositry to start with and if you find better ones please do use those as well.

### 1. The below notebook will be the first step to learning NLP (ie) Regular Expression "NLP-Step1-Regular Expression.ipynb"

### 2. The notebook "Normalization-stemming-lemmatization-Countvectorizer-TF-IDF.ipynb" contains the basic steps of normalizing the text. Post this we Stem or lemmatize the text to reduce vocabulary count and finally we convert them to vectors using Count Vectorizer or TF-IDF. Although CV or TF-IDF is never used in todays problem statement, its always good to know from where we started.

### 3. The notebook 'Word2Vec_GloVe_SimpleChatbot_using_TFIDF.ipynb' contains the codes to generate Word2vec vectors, use a pretrained word2vec vectors and also use pretrained GloVe vector. Post this we have created a simple Chatbot using TF-IDF vectorizer.

### 4. The notebook 'Chatbot_Word2vec_GloVe_LSTM_RNN_GRU.ipynb'contains codes to generate Wordvec vectors in selftrained and pretrained version and Glove Pretrained version. This notebook also shows how to create an Embedding neural network layer to pass all these embeddings inside and make better prediction.


          

### Project1_NLP - This contains basic NLP classification problem solved through TF-IDF vectorizer and a mini Chatbot.
